# Final Conclusion

## Project Overview
- This project developed a system to automatically classify emails as "spam" or "ham" (non-spam), addressing the widespread issue of unwanted spam messages. The solution leverages machine learning techniques to effectively identify spam emails.

## Steps Undertaken
1. **Data Collection**
   - Gathered a dataset containing both spam and non-spam messages for training and evaluation.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Noise Removal**: Removed non-letter characters like special characters and numbers.
   - **Text Standardization**: Converted all text to lowercase and removed common stopwords.
   - **Stemming**: Reduced words to their root forms to enhance data consistency.
   - **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Used `CountVectorizer` with unigrams and bigrams to transform text data into a structured numeric format, selecting up to 2500 features.

3. **Feature Selection**
   - Extracted relevant word patterns and structured them using BoW for meaningful model training.

4. **Model Selection**
   - **Algorithms Tested**: 
     - **Naive Bayes (Multinomial)**: Known for high performance with text data.
     - **Decision Tree (J48)**: A robust choice for classification tasks, offering interpretability.
   - **Training and Testing**: Data was split into 70% training and 30% testing sets.
   - **Final Model Choice**:
     - Naive Bayes achieved **99% accuracy**, outperforming the Decision Tree model, which reached **96% accuracy**.
     - The Naive Bayes model was selected as the primary classifier due to its:
       - Superior accuracy on text data
       - Efficiency in handling high-dimensional BoW features
       - Faster computation, ideal for real-time filtering tasks

5. **Performance Evaluation**
   - Assessed each model using **accuracy scores** and **confusion matrices**.
   - Naive Bayes was chosen for its high accuracy and efficiency, making it optimal for text-based spam classification.

## Final Results
- **Chosen Model**: Naive Bayes (Multinomial) was selected as the primary model for email classification.
- **Accuracy**: Achieved an impressive 99% accuracy with Naive Bayes on test data.
- **Conclusion**: This project successfully applied machine learning to spam detection, achieving high classification accuracy. Naive Bayes emerged as the most suitable model for this task, providing a practical and reliable solution for real-world spam filtering.
